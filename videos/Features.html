                    <h2>#Agents</h2>
                    <p>There are a large variety of playable agents available in the game. Each agent has a different class which indicates how the agent is usually played.
                        Duelists are the offensive line, which specialize in attacking and entry fragging for the team. Duelists include Jett, Phoenix, Reyna, Raze and Yoru.
                        Sentinels are the defensive line, which specialize in locking down sites and protecting teammates from enemies. Sentinels include Sage, Cypher
                        and Killjoy.Next are initiators who plan out the offensive pushes. Initiators specialize in breaking through defensive enemy positions. Initiators 
                        include Skye, Sova and Breach.

                     <h2>Gunplay</h2>
                     <p>The gunplay draws significant inspiration from Counter-Strike, as each weapon has a unique spray pattern. Furthermore, recoil stabilization, such as crouching, is also a prominent mechanic in the game. Crosshairs placement matters
                        too because of players clearing and holding angles the same way players would in CS.</p>

                                        <p><b>BIND</b> Bind is a two site map (A and B) that has attackers infiltrating from a beach coast.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                A unique aspect of this map is that there are two one-way teleporters. One teleporter takes you from long B to the attacker’s side of showers.The other takes you from short A to the attacker’s side of hookah.These allow both attackers and defenders alike to quickly rotate or flank the opposing team.

                                            <b>HAVEN</b> Haven is a three site map (A, B, C), which is also its unique aspect as most bomb/defusal maps in FPS games tend to be two sites.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Site B is accessible through a window which leads into an outdoor courtyard. The courtyard also leads to a set of doors called “garage” which allows attackers to wrap around to Site B.
                                            The garage also acts as a connector to Site C, so attackers that make it through can threaten both B and C.

                                            <b>Ascent</b> Ascent was the first new map to be added since Valorant’s official release.
                                            The courtyard offers a quick short cut to the sides of the map but is risky to cross since it doesn’t contain that much cover.

                                             planting sites, meaning that you have a low ground option to plant on and a high ground one.

                                        <p>
                                            It’s a great map for agents like Raze, Jett, and Omen that are able to make good use of all the boxes while agents like Sova and
                                            Cypher may struggle. Sova because it will be easy to hide from his sonar arrow and Cypher because there are many access points so
                                            his Trapwires may not get as much value as usual.
